								<h3>Parental Leave</h3>
<p>Amazingly, the United States is the only developed nation in the world that does not mandate paid parental leave - at least at the federal level. Currently 3 states ( California, New Jersey and Washington) operate programs that require private-sector employers to pay their employees’ parental leave (at least partially).</p>

<p>But just because your organization operates in a state where paid parental leave is not required, you will still bear costs associated with such a lengthy leave. Firstly, US federal law require employers to permit employees parental leave of 12 weeks with a guarantee of their job on return (exceptions based on the number of employees your organization employs).</p>

<p>This situation is difficult for the employer - especially when the employee on leave plays an important and/or specialized role in the organization. The only option employers may have are to fill the gap by paying other employees to work overtime during the 12 weeks, or hire contract labor - both forms costing much more than the regularly paid employee taking leave, and (usually) producing less.</p>

<p>Either way, fulfilling the role of the employee on leave may cost 50% more than normal and does not include the cost of sourcing contract labor should that route be chosen. Since we know this is a potentiality, we must consider or estimate the risk factor. We can tease out a workable factor from the current labor force, live birth and unemployment statistics.</p>

<p>Simplifying our birth figure we’ll say 3,000,000 births to mothers of professional ages and supposing 90% of those women are employed. Considering eligibility, we’re close to 1% the workforce taking parental leave each year. Amortize that cost across each employee: 12 weeks / 50 weeks * 50% extra (overtime or contractor) cost * 1% = 0.12%.</p>

<p>Thankfully the number is small but we must also consider that it is only a probability. The possible that the rate of parental leaves could spike and cost your organization much more than estimated. Or, your organization may not employ enough workers to spread this potential cost across their calculated “loaded and compenstated” rates.</p>

<p>In either case, it is wise to pad the figure to prepare us for such potentialities. Lets instead assign parental leave factor of 1% and bring our “loaded and compensated” rate to 38%.</p>

<h3>Jury Duty</h3>

<p>In the US, jury duty is a legal obligation and enshrined in the constitution. While only approximately 1.5 million citizens are “impaneled” to jury duty (the court procession moves forward and a case is heard), over 32 million people are summoned each year and it still involves time off work even if they case never gets to trial. And, the average four or five days presiding impaneled as a juror does not consider what might be perhaps four or five days attending pre-trial interviews and jury training.</p>

<p>We will allow two weeks as safe estimate of the average time jury duty demands workers from their employment. While US companies are not obligated to pay workers during absenteeism due to the call of duty, there is still a cost that can be associated to the productivity loss.</p>

<p>Because of the uncertainty of the length of time jury cases demand, it is usually unreasonable to consider fulfilling the position with temporary workers. Most businesses are forced to resort to paying their employee’s colleagues overtime pay and/or simply suffering the loss in productivity and profits.</p>

<p>If we consider that 0.7% of our work force will be impaneled we will lose 2 weeks of their productivity and profit losses, we should compensate for this by raising our “loaded and compensated” rate by 1% to 39%.</p>
