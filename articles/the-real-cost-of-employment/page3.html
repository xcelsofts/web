								<h3>Potential Liabilities</h3>
<p>Bad things happen to the best of people. The insurance companies understand this well and they base their business on gauging probabilities.</p>

<p>For example, given enough time, a chimp punching at random on a typewriter would almost certainly type out the word ‘banana’ - and we’d happily give him one for doing so.</p>

<p>Like the infinite chimp theorem, there are probabilities or eventualities that we see play out in the marketplace, with clear statistics on recurring events such as wrongful dismissal suits, employees being called to jury duty, surprise pregnancies, or simply a bad hire resulting in a termination of employment and the need to source candidates all over again.</p>

<p>If we don’t factor in these “probabilities” then we may be unprepared to handle them when they eventually occur. As an insurance policy, we should consider compensating for such potentialities in our “loaded” rate which we will now refer to as the “loaded and compensated” rate.</p>

<h3>Wrongful Termination Suits</h3>
<p>A wrongful dismissal suit can be an enormously expensive loss - court costs and lawyer fees, lost time for management to appear in court, and finally damages should the former employee as plaintiff win their case. It’s a statistically common occurrence in the business world and should you think that it won’t happen to you and your organization because you are a kind person who follows the law, there is still a strong possibility you will be very sadly surprised.</p>

<p>While it is certain that there are many instances of legitimate wrongful termination cases, the sword swings both ways and if you ask around you’ll hear many shocking stories about former employees doing terrible things (like fraud and theft) to cause their dismissal yet still winning large settlements in court.
Remember, sometimes an employee may be scheming a wrongful dismissal suit and coerce the conditions in the workplace that would allow him or her to win in court.</p>

<p>The methods the courts use to determine damages is complicated but overall it involves assessing the loss in income the former employee has experienced against what their income would have been had they not been dismissed. Also known as “but-for” earnings, the court tries to estimate what the plaintiff would have earned “but-for” had they not been terminated - usually for a period not surpassing three years since their dismissal.</p>

<p>Over the course of these three years, the wrongfully dismissed person has the obligation to seek similar work and similar pay in the market. Those earnings are referred to as the “mitigation earnings” and they subtracted from the “but-for” earnings to produce an estimated amount representing the loss of earnings or damages.</p>

<p>What we can take from this is that in the case of wrongful dismissal, an employer may be faced with paying damages for up to three years for just over 50% of those filing and winning their wrongful dismissal cases. Of the remaining 50% who have found employment some time after their dismissal (mitigation income), more than 50% will still have significant “damages” as their new incomes fall short of their former incomes.</p>

<p>In 2010, there were 55,019 EEOC filings of wrong dismissal charges. Contrast this against the approximately 139,266,000 employed in 2010 and we can estimate that wrong dismissal cases are brought about by approximately 0.04% of the work force - a thankfully low number but statistically still significant.</p>

<p>For lack of a definitive study, we’ll have to estimate the average damages and court costs versus income - 200% of an employee’s salary can be suggested as a conservative number that includes damages, legal costs, and lost productivity. Given that occurrences are only 0.04% we’ll calculate and round up a factor to adjust our “loaded and compensated” rate by 1%  (which now stands at 37%).</p>

<p>For a larger company, which employs many, this compensation in calculating the real cost of employment should generally cover the costs of wrongful dismissal cases that are statistically likely to occur in a company employing a large workforce. For a small company, where the odds of such a case occurring are lower, the damages could be much higher than the compensation calculation - something that should be considered for small or medium-sized businesses when hiring.</p>
