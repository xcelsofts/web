								<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>There are other forms of engaging workers that are not regarded as traditional employment, nor do they carry the same legal burdens and expenses. You might consider breaking off some off the tasks you need completed into contract work - the legality here is important to understand as the law may not share with you the notion that certain work is viable for contract and not actually traditional employment with tax obligations and other legal requirements. Do you research before you consider contract work.</p>

<p>Another form that has a long history is outsourcing, where another company provides the manpower (human resource) as a service. The outsourcing company maintains the employment relation with the worker and most, if not all of the obligations towards that relationship. Naturally you will pay more for the same level of expertise, however your organization is shielded from some of the more expensive eventualities and the sourcing and pre-screening is managed by the outsourcing company leaving you the advantage of only having to make the final decision between the pick-of-the-crop candidates.</p>

<p>Outsourcing comes in many forms - a particularly advantageous variant is offshore outsourcing in which candidates are selected from foreign countries where, typically, wages are *much* lower. Offshore outsourcing has gained some notoriety stemming from a higher-than-usual failure rate. Most failures in offshoring are commonly related to communication problems and an inability to manage the workers when they are half-way across the world (ie. India).</p>

<p>Many small and medium-sized companies are unable to afford infrastructure to manage far-away resources in opposing timezones so offshore outsourcing is largely an advantage reserved for larger multinational corporations.</p>

<p>However, in the earlier part of this century a new form of outsourcing called “nearshore” started to become popular because it allowed smaller businesses to effectively manage “nearshore” resources without a large management overhead.</p>

<p>It still maintains the benefit of dramatically lower wages for the same expertise by sourcing from foreign (non-western or developing) countries, but it is defined mostly by being in the same or near timezone as the contracting company. From Canada and the US, those nearshore resources may be from Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru or Argentina.</p>

<p>Today it is a trivial exercise to manage a worker by communicating via the internet and more and more a common practice as workers work from home (telecommute) instead of the office. If your organization is a small or medium-sized business and struggling with the real costs and potential (eventual) liabilities of traditional employment, then nearshore outsourcing may be a solution.</p>

<p>Nearshore outsourcing provides more than just experienced employees in various fields (particularly software), they provide a stable and managed environment for the workers that improves productivity and manages workers and their projects to reduce risk of failed projects. It does all this while delivering the same or better expertise for a fraction of the “real cost” of employment as the outsourcing company will bear the burden of employment obligations.</p>
